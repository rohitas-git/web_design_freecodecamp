# Box Model for HTML element
In the CSS box model, every HTML element is treated as a box with four areas.
- Content
- Padding
- Border
- Margin

Imagine you receive a box from your favorite online retailer:--

- Content
Content is the item in the box, or in our case, a header, paragraph, or image element.

- Padding
The content is surrounded by a space called padding, similar to how bubble wrap separates an item from the box around it.

- Border
Think of the border like the cardboard box your item was shipped in.

- Margin
Margin is the area outside of the box, and can be used to control the space between other boxes or elements.


### <div>

Even though your <div> has no text, it's still treated as a box with content.
